The [HbA1c test](https://depts.washington.edu/uwcoe/healthtopics/diabetes.html) measures what the average blood sugar has been over the past three months. It is thus a powerful way to get an overall sense of how well diabetes has been controlled. Everyone with diabetes should have this test 2 to 4 times per year. Measured in %.\n",

For Auralin to be deemed effective, it must be \"noninferior\" to Novodra, the current standard for insulin. This \"noninferiority\" is statistically defined as the upper bound of the 95% confidence interval being less than 0.4% for the difference between the mean HbA1c changes for Novodra and Auralin (i.e. Novodra minus Auralin)."

Ideally you want short column names (so they are easier to type and read in code form) but also fully descriptive. Length vs. descriptiveness is a tradeoff and common debate (a [similar debate](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/176582/is-there-an-excuse-for-short-variable-names) exists for variable names). The *auralin* and *novodra* column names are probably not descriptive enough, but you'll address that later so don't worry about that for now."

    "## Data Quality Dimensions\n",
    "Data quality dimensions help guide your thought process while assessing and also cleaning. The four main data quality dimensions are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. __Completeness:__ do we have all of the records that we should? Do we have missing records or not? Are there specific rows, columns, or cells missing?\n",
    "2. __Validity:__ we have the records, but they're not valid, i.e., they don't conform to a defined schema. A schema is a defined set of rules for data. These rules can be real-world constraints (e.g. negative height is impossible) and table-specific constraints (e.g. unique key constraints in tables).\n",
    "3. __Accuracy:__ inaccurate data is wrong data that is valid. It adheres to the defined schema, but it is still incorrect. Example: a patient's weight that is 5 lbs too heavy because the scale was faulty.\n",
    "4. __Consistency:__ inconsistent data is both valid and accurate, but there are multiple correct ways of referring to the same thing. Consistency, i.e., a standard format, in columns that represent the same data across tables and/or within tables is desired.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding the other data quality research mentioned in the video, the additional dimensions are super specific cases of these four dimensions listed above. Example: _currency_, defined as follows: _the degree to which data is current with the world that it models. Currency can measure how up-to-date data is_. Currency is a specific case of accuracy data in the sense that out-of-date data is (usually) valid but wrong. In other words, accuracy is a relaxed definition of currency.\n",
