    "There are two types of unclean data:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Dirty data, also known as low quality data. Low quality data has content issues.\n",
    "- Messy data, also known as untidy data. Untidy data has structural issues.\n",

    "Why write observations of issues instead of writing observations as well as how to fix them? When your data's issues get complicated, writing how to fix each can get confusing, lengthy, and time-consuming. It can get overwhelming trying to think of how to clean something complicated immediately after documenting it.\n",

    "If you are separating the assessing and cleaning steps of data wrangling, as we are in this lesson, writing observations only is good practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you choose to assess an issue then immediately clean that issue (which is very much allowed), you can skip the observation and go straight to defining how to clean it "
